    <p style=" background-color: rgb(245, 195, 32); color: black;"> Temple Run is one of my favorite game.It is a 3d game which can be played on mobile, tablets and laptops.The primary theme of the series is  an explorer chased from a group of demon monkeys, however, the characters and theme vary between spin- offs.the player controls a player character with the perspective behind the player character's back.while the character is running, the player can swipe left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and avoid obstacles. The player can also swipe down to slide down towards the ground or swipe up to jump. If the path leads to a turn, the player must swipe toward the direction of the turn to successfully stay on the path. Intersections on the path allow the player to choose different paths. If the player does not avoid obstacles or doesn't turn to stay on the path, the player will fall off the path or die and lose. Throughout the path, there are coins to collect.</p>
